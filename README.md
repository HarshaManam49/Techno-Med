## Introduction

This Website is for Users and Lab Technicians:

- **For Users**
  
  The application offers a Model which can predict disease based on the symptoms they have.
  
- **Lab Technician**
  
  The application offers the following 5 Features to the Lab Technicians:
      
      - Heart-Disease prediction
      - Diabetes prediction
      - Brain Tumour prediction
      - Malaria prediction
      - Breast Cancer prediction
The website also has its own chatbot, Tmedo for interaction.
  

## Technologies
- Machine Learning Classification Algorithms:

  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Logistic regression
      
- Deep Learning Algorithms :

  - Convolutional Neural Networks
       
## Frameworks
 
 - Streamlit

## What We learnt

Through this project, we learnt many new things likeâ€“
- Deploying different Machine Learning & Deep Learning models in one place for one goal.

- The basics of Streamlit framework for better UI and integrating different models.

- Having learned the concept of Machine Learning & Deep Learning, we could ponder and think about its real-life application for the enhancement of healthcare services.

- Team spirit & Collective growth undoubtedly are some of the most important things we learned while
working on the project. 
  
## Experience while working on the Project

The project was an amazing experience. It required a great amount of brainstorming, exploring, and effort to bring it from a mere concept to reality. Collaborating on it as a team was incredibly thrilling. The journey of constructing the application began with pondering on the basic idea, followed by each of us working independently to construct models and frameworks. But soon, we started collaborating and working together as a team on the entire project. In the end, we could integrate four machine learning models and three deep learning models using the Streamlit framework for our project. 

## Keypoints of the Project

- The application has many features related to healthcare like disease prediction from symptoms, diabetes prediction, heart disease prediction, brain tumor prediction, breast cancer prediction, and malaria prediction.
- It has its very own chatbot, Tmedo. This was built with a customized dataset & responses and is interactive.
- Streamlit is used to deploy the models and build the application.
- The Models used in the project are:
  - Chatbot (using Logistic Regression model)
  - disease prediction from symptoms (using Multinomial Naive Bayes model)
  - diabetes prediction (using Logistic Regression model)
  - heart disease prediction (using Logistic Regression model)
  - brain tumor prediction (using CNN) 
  - Malaria (using CNN)
  - Breast Cancer (using CNN)
